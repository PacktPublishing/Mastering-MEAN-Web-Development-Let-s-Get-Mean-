# Chapter 1: Getting up and Started with M.E.A.N. Stack

Alright, fellow developers, I know you're itching to dive into code—trust me, I am too! But before we jump headfirst into the MEAN stack ocean, let's take a quick moment to get our bearings. Think of it as checking our gear before a thrilling expedition. We'll briefly explore why MEAN is such a powerhouse for modern web development and quickly recap its core components. Then, I'll give you a sneak peek at the exciting projects we'll be building together. After that, we'll roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty setting up a rock-solid development environment. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a fully functional MEAN setup, ready to bring your web application ideas to life. So, take a deep breath, grab your favorite caffeinated beverage - tea works wonders too, and let's embark on this MEAN stack journey together!

## Why Choose M.E.A.N.?

In a world brimming with options, why should you hitch your wagon to the MEAN star? Well, buckle up, and let's take an express tour of MEAN's greatest hits!

First off, it's JavaScript all the way down. From database queries to server-side logic, right through to the client-side UI, it's JS everywhere. It means you can flex your JavaScript muscles across the entire stack, leading to faster development, easier maintenance, and fewer "context switch" headaches.

But wait, there's more! MEAN is like the Swiss Army knife of web development:

1. **Flexibility**: MongoDB's schema-less nature means you can evolve your data model without breaking a sweat. Perfect for those "oh, we need to add this feature yesterday" moments.

2. **Scalability**: Node.js and MongoDB are built to scale. Whether you're serving a handful of users or suddenly going viral, MEAN's got your back.

3. **Real-time Ready**: Node.js excels at handling real-time applications. Chat apps, live updates, collaborative tools? MEAN's your stack.

4. **Single Page Application (SPA) Superstar**: Angular shines when it comes to building SPAs. Smooth, responsive, app-like experiences? Check, check, and check.

5. **Community and Ecosystem**: Each component of MEAN has a massive, active community. This translates to a wealth of packages, tools, and resources at your fingertips.

6. **Cost-Effective**: Open-source all the way, baby! Your wallet will thank you.

7. **JSON Joys**: With MongoDB storing data in a JSON-like format and JavaScript's native JSON handling, data flows smoothly through your entire application.

Now, I'm not saying MEAN is the be-all and end-all of web development. Every project has its own needs, and sometimes another stack might be a better fit. But for building modern, scalable, JavaScript-powered web applications? MEAN is tough to beat.

So, if you're looking to add a versatile, powerful tool to your web development arsenal, you're in the right place. MEAN will not only equip you to build robust, scalable applications but also keep you at the forefront of modern web development trends.

Ready to dive deeper? Let's take a quick look at what makes up this mighty stack!


## M.E.A.N. Stack Recap: Core Components Overview

The MEAN stack is like a rock band where each member brings their unique talent to create something awesome. Let's meet the band:

### M is for MongoDB: The Data Rockstar 🎸

Picture MongoDB as the bassist of our band – it lays down the foundation that everything else builds upon. 

- **What it does**: Stores your data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Why it's cool**: 
  - No rigid schemas here! Your data can be as structured or unstructured as you like.
  - Scales horizontally like a boss. Need more capacity? Just add more machines.
  - Speaks JSON fluently, making it a perfect match for JavaScript.

### E is for Express.js: The Rhythm Guitarist 🎸

Express.js is like the rhythm guitarist, providing the framework that keeps everything tight and organized.

- **What it does**: Handles routing, middleware, and basic server-side logic.
- **Why it's cool**:
  - Minimalist and flexible. It doesn't force you into a rigid structure.
  - Huge ecosystem of middleware. There's probably a package for anything you want to do.
  - Makes building RESTful APIs a breeze.

### A is for Angular: The Lead Vocalist 🎤

Angular takes the spotlight as our lead vocalist, wowing the crowd (aka your users) with its performances.

- **What it does**: Builds dynamic, single-page client applications.
- **Why it's cool**:
  - Component-based architecture for reusable, maintainable code.
  - Built-in tools for routing, form validation, and HTTP communication.
  - TypeScript support for catching errors before they hit production.

### N is for Node.js: The Drummer 🥁

Node.js is our drummer, setting the tempo and rhythm for the entire application.

- **What it does**: Runs your server-side JavaScript code.
- **Why it's cool**:
  - Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Translation: It's fast and efficient.
  - Vast ecosystem of packages via npm. There's a tool for almost everything.
  - Allows you to use JavaScript on the server, unifying your full-stack language.

Together, these four create a harmonious full-stack symphony. MongoDB stores the data, Express.js routes it around, Angular presents it to the user, and Node.js powers the whole show.

But here's the real magic: they all speak the same language - JavaScript. It's like every band member knowing exactly what the others are saying, all the time. This harmony leads to faster development, easier debugging, and a smoother overall experience for you, the developer.

Now that you've met the band, are you ready to start jamming? Let's take a look at the awesome projects we'll be creating with this stack!


## Projects Roadmap: What You Will Build

We're not just going to learn about MEAN; we're going to build with it. By the end of this book, you'll have two impressive projects under your belt. Let's take a sneak peek at what's in store:

So, are you ready to rock the MEAN stack? Strap in, because it's going to be an exciting ride! But first, let's make sure your development environment is tuned up and ready to go.


## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Our fantastic band of four needs a stage to perform on, and that stage is your development environment. Let's get everything set up so you can start building your MEAN applications.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is the backbone of our stack, so let's get it installed. For Mac and Linux users, We recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for easier management. If you don't have Homebrew, install it first by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
After installing Homebrew, you can install Node.js Long Time Support - or LTS - version by running this command:
```bash
brew install node
```
For Windows users, you can download the installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the instructions.

To verify that Node.js is installed correctly, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
Npm is Node.js's package manager, and it should be installed along with Node.js. If you see version numbers for both commands, you're good to go!

**Quick note:** If you already have Node.js installed, make sure you have a recent version - we are using **version 22.3.0** for this book. you can also use a version manager like [nvm](https://nvm.sh/) to manage multiple Node.js versions on your machine.

### Step 2: Install MongoDB

MongoDB is our data powerhouse, so let's get it up and running. We will first look into a complete local development setup, and later in the book, we will explore cloud-based options. For the local setup, we will install MongoDB Community Edition.

You can install MongoDB Community Edition by following the instructions on the [official MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) and choose the appropriate platform for your needs: [MacOs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/), [Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/), or [Linux](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/). There is also a [Docker option](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-docker/) if you prefer that, but we won't cover it in this book.

For Mac users, the quick way to install MongoDB is by using Homebrew that we installed earlier. You can tap the MongoDB formulae by running:
```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
```
and then target the current community edition version, which is 7.0 at the time of writing this book:
```bash
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
```
After installing MongoDB, you can start the MongoDB service by running:
```bash
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```
and to check if the service is running, you can run:
```bash
brew services list
```
which should show you *__mongodb-community__* listed as *__started__*.

We also recommend installing MongoDB Compass, a graphical user interface for MongoDB. You can download it from the [MongoDB Compass website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass). This will make it way easier to create and interact with our databases.

If you are more shell-inclined, you will also have access to the MongoDB shell - **mongosh**, which you can use to interact with your databases directly. More information on how to use the MongoDB shell can be found in the [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/).

*__TODO: Add more instructions for Windows and Linux users.__*

### Step 3: Install Angular CLI

Angular CLI is our trusty sidekick for building Angular applications. Let's get it installed globally by running:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
After installing Angular CLI, you can verify the installation by running:
```bash
ng version
```
At the time of writing this book, we are using Angular CLI version 18.0.6. and here is part of the output similar to what you should see:
```bash
Angular CLI: 18.0.6
Node: 22.3.0
Package Manager: npm 10.8.1
OS: darwin arm64
```

The install process for Angular CLI is similar across platforms, but if you encounter any issues, you can refer to the [official Angular CLI documentation](https://angular.dev/tools/cli).

### Step 4: Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

You can use any text editor or IDE you're comfortable with, but we will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's lightweight, powerful, and has excellent support for JavaScript and TypeScript. We will also tap into its extensive set of extensions to make our development experience even better.

*__TODO: Add a VS Code profile for the book with recommended extensions and settings.__*

### Step 5: MEAN Workspace Setup

Now that we have our tools installed, let's create a basic MEAN stack workspace that will serve as the foundation for our future projects.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to where you want to create your project.
3. Create a new directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir mean-workspace && cd mean-workspace
```
4. Initialize a new Git repository:
```bash
git init
```
5. Let's add a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control. You can create a new file and add the following content:
```bash
echo "node_modules/\n.env\ndist/" > .gitignore
``` 
This will exclude the `node_modules` directory, `.env` files, and the `dist` directory from being committed to your repository. We will add more entries to this file as we progress through the book.
6. Create directories for your backend and frontend code:
```bash
mkdir backend frontend
```
7. Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
npm init -y
```
This will create a `package.json` file with default values at the root of your backend directory and allow us to install the different dependencies needed to run it. Let's install Express, dotenv, cors, and Mongoose as our initial dependencies.

Let's move to VS Code for the next steps. If you have the `code` command added to your path, type:
```bash
cd .. && code .
```
If not, you can open VS Code and navigate to the `mean-workspace` directory.

Your project current directory structure should look like this:
```bash
└── 📁mean-workspace
    └── .gitignore
    └── 📁backend
        └── package.json
        └── server.js
    ├── frontend
```

Now open the integrated terminal using the "Terminal" menu and select "New Terminal" or use the shortcut `Ctrl + `~`. Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd backend && npm install express dotenv cors mongoose
```
After installing those, our `package.json` file should look like this:
```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
    "express": "^4.17.2",
    "mongoose": "^6.1.0"
  }
}
```
Your packages versions might be different but it will install all the latest versions for each.

Now let's set up a minimal Express server to test if everything is working correctly. Create an `server.js` file in the `backend` directory and add the following code:
```javascript
// backend/server.js

import express from 'express';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import cors from 'cors';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as url from 'url';
import * as path from 'path';

// Set up __dirname equivalent for ES modules
const __filename = url.fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

dotenv.config();

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

await mongoose.connect(
  process.env.MONGODB_URI || 
  'mongodb://localhost:27017/mean-workspace'
);

const Hello = mongoose.model('Hello', { message: String });

app.get('/api/hello', async (req, res) => {
  const hello = await Hello.findOne();
  res.json({ message: hello ? hello.message : 'Hello from MEAN stack!' });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
Since we are using `import` statements instead of `require` we need to add `"type": "module"` to the `package.json` file to tell Node.js that we are using ES modules:
```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  //... rest remains the same
}
```
While still in the `backend` directory, you can start the server by running:
```bash
node server.js
```
You should see a message in the terminal saying "Server running at http://localhost:3000". If you open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`, you should see a JSON response with the message "Hello from MEAN stack!".

Awesome you now have set a minimal server using Express.js and connected it to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. This is the foundation of our backend application. 

8. Now let's set up the frontend. Open a new terminal in VS Code and navigate and ensure you are in the `mean-workspace` directory by typing:
```bash
pwd
```
9. It is good practice to commit our changes before creating a lot of new files with the Angular generator. You can do this by running:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
10. Now let's create a new branch and add Angular to our frontend directory:
```bash
git checkout -b frontend-setup
ng new frontend --defaults --dry-run
```
This will show you the files that will be created by the Angular CLI. If everything looks good, you can run the command without the `--dry-run` flag to create the files:
```bash
ng new frontend --defaults
```
This will create a new Angular project with the default settings inside the `frontend` folder. You can now navigate to it start the development server by running:
```bash
cd frontend && ng serve
```
This will start the Angular development server and you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see the default Angular application running.

You now have all the building blocks of your MEAN stack setup, but while the Express layer is connecting to the MongoDB database, the Angular frontend is not yet connected to the backend and they are not running in sync. So let's remedy that right now.

11. First let's commit our latest changes to the project. From the root run:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Angular frontend app added and served"
```
We can clearly seprate and document our progress by creating a new branch for it. First let's create a `develop` branch that will serve as our main development branch:
```bash
git checkout -b develop
```
12. Now let's create a `workspace-sync` branch:
```bash
git checkout -b workspace-sync
```
Still in your terminal, add a new `package.json` file to the workspace by running:
```bash
npm init -y
```
This will create a setup similar to the one we had for the `backend` directory with the `name` set to `mean-workspace` and the `version` set to `1.0.0`. 
As of version 7.0, npm introduced workspaces that allow you to manage multiple packages in a single top-level, root package. This is perfect for our MEAN stack setup. We will do this in 4 steps:

1. Add the `backend` and `frontend` directories to the `workspaces` array in the `package.json` file:
```json
{
  "name": "mean-workspace",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "workspaces": [
    "backend",
    "frontend"
  ]
}
```
The order of the directories in the `workspaces` array is important as it will determine the order in which the workspaces are run.
2. Add the `start` script to the `package.json` file:
```json
{
  "name": "mean-workspace",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "workspaces": [
    "backend",
    "frontend"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npm run start --workspaces"
  }
}
```
3. Add the `start` script in the `backend/package.json` file:
```json
// backend/package.json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  //...
}
```
If you followed the Angular CLI defaults, the `start` script should already be in the `frontend/package.json` file and should look like this:
```json
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    //...
  }
  //...
}
```
4. Remove all the `node_modules` directories from the `backend` and `frontend` directories by running:
```bash
rm -rf backend/node_modules frontend/node_modules
```
and do the same for any exixting `package-lock.json` files:
```bash
rm -rf backend/package-lock.json frontend/package-lock.json
```
This will start you on a clean slate and have one central `node_modules` directory at the root of the workspace. From the root install all the dependencies by running:
```
npm install
``` 
You will see that the dependencies for both the `backend` and `frontend` directories are installed in the root `node_modules` directory and there is now only one `package-lock.json` as the single source of truth for the workspace. 

We will show later on how to install packages specific to each domain, but as a general rule of thumb, all dependencies will be combined in one central place at the root level of the workspace.

Now you can run the `start` script from the root of the workspace by running:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the backend server but you will see that if there are no errors that the frontend server did not start. 
Basically the node process of running the backend is never completed and the second target is never executed. 
To remedy to that, we will add `concurrently` to our workspace. This will allow us to run multiple commands concurrently.
Install `concurrently` by running:
```bash
npm install -D concurrently
```
and now we will modify the `start` command in the `package.json` like so:
```json
{
  "name": "mean-workspace",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "workspaces": [
    "backend",
    "frontend"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run start --workspace=backend\" \"npm run start --workspace=frontend\"",
  }
}
```
Now running back the `npm start` command from the root of the workspace will start both the backend and frontend servers concurrently. You should be able to now navigate to `http://localhost:4200` and see the Angular application and to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello` and see the JSON response from the backend server.

That should conclude our installations steps since you now have an Express backend connectig to a MongoDB database and an Angular frontend running in the same workspace, but the `frontend` and `backend` are not directly connected. We will address that first in the next chapter and make sure that they are ready for their first band rehearsal.

## Troubleshooting and Next Steps

Congratulations on setting up your MEAN stack development environment! You've laid the foundation for building powerful, full-stack JavaScript applications. But let's face it – even the most meticulously planned setups can sometimes hit a snag. Don't worry; we've got you covered.

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Node.js or npm not recognized**
   If your terminal doesn't recognize `node` or `npm` commands, ensure that Node.js is properly installed and added to your system's PATH. Try closing and reopening your terminal, or logging out and back into your system.

2. **MongoDB connection issues**
   If you're having trouble connecting to MongoDB, check that the MongoDB service is running. On macOS, use `brew services list` to verify. For Windows users, check the Services application. Also, ensure your connection string in the `.env` file is correct.

3. **Angular CLI installation fails**
   If you encounter permission errors when installing Angular CLI globally, try using `sudo` on macOS/Linux or run the command prompt as an administrator on Windows.

4. **"Port already in use" errors**
   If you see this error when starting your servers, it means another process is already using that port. Try identifying and closing the process, or change the port number in your configuration.

5. **Workspace sync issues**
   If `npm start` isn't running both servers, double-check your `package.json` scripts and ensure `concurrently` is installed correctly.

6. **"SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" in Express**
   If you're using ES6 import statements in your Express server and encounter this error, it's likely because you forgot to add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`. Add this line to your backend's `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "backend",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "type": "module",
     ...
   }


### Verifying Your Setup

To ensure everything is working correctly:

1. Run `npm start` from the root of your workspace.
2. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. You should see the default Angular app.
3. In another tab, go to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. You should see the JSON response from your Express server.

If both of these work, congratulations! Your MEAN stack is up and running.

### Next Steps

Now that your development environment is set up, you're ready to start building. Here's what's coming up:

1. **Connecting the Dots**: In the next chapter, we'll integrate the Angular frontend with the Express backend, creating a truly full-stack application.

2. **Data Modeling**: We'll dive deeper into MongoDB and Mongoose, learning how to design efficient data models for our applications.

3. **RESTful API Design**: You'll learn how to create a robust API using Express, following RESTful principles.

4. **Angular Deep Dive**: We'll explore Angular's powerful features, including components, services, and routing.

5. **Authentication and Authorization**: Security is crucial, so we'll implement user authentication and authorization in our MEAN stack.

Remember, the key to mastering the MEAN stack is practice. Don't be afraid to experiment, break things, and learn from the process. If you get stuck, revisit this chapter, consult the official documentation for each technology, or reach out to the vibrant MEAN stack community online.
